# Output:
#   What is your age? 15
#   You are not old enough to legally drive.
#   or
#   What is your age? 35
#   You are old enough to legally drive.
# Constraints:
#   - Use a single output statement.
#   - Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your language doesnâ€™t
#   support a ternary operator, use a reg- ular if/else statement, and still
#   use a single output state- ment to display the message.
