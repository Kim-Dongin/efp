# Exercise 3. Printing Quotes
# Output:
#   What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
#   Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
#   Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
# Constraints:
#   Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate
#   string-escaping techniques for quotes.
#   If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution,
#   don't use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.
